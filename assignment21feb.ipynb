    "# EC2 from AWS Services is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offering. It provides you with secure, scalable,\n",
    "# and resizable server instances with desired compute capacity. You can select the OS, its RAM, storage capacity, and processor. In an EC2 instance,\n",
    "# you can do anything from installing software and IDE for programming to even hosting a website. With the help of EC2, you can easily boot and run new server\n",
    "# instances known as EC2 instances. Major companies that use EC2 in their cloud architecture are Toyota, Netflix, and Salesforce. \n",
    "# Learn the difference between AWS and Salesforce in our comparison blog on AWS vs Salesforce.\n",
    "# 2) Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering from AWS that helps you in hosting a website. As it \n",
    "# is PaaS, you do not get complete access to the operating system. Rather, you get a dashboard, and with the help of\n",
    "# it, you can upload your code, which will be hosted automatically. Using this dashboard, you can run your EC2 instances and databases and easily integrate other AWS services,\n",
    "# such as Elastic Load Balancing.\n",
    "# 3) AWS Firewall Manager is a web application firewall that protects web applications or API gateway against common \n",
    "# web exploits and bots. It simplifies the administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources for a variety of protections such as AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, Amazon VPC security groups, AWS Network Firewall,\n",
    "# and Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall.\n",
    "# 4) Amazon Cognito is one of the services offered by Amazon that controls user authentication and access for mobile \n",
    "# applications. One of the key functions of Amazon Cognito is that it saves and synchronizes end-user data, \n",
    "# which lets an application developer focus on code without worrying about the back-end infrastructure.\n",
    "# This further accelerates the mobile application development process. It also supports end-users sign-in in with\n",
